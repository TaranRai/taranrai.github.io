          <h3>Graduated from Keele University üéì</h3>
          <em>Jul 2013</em>
          <p>	
            I graduated from Keele University with a 2:1 in BA (Dual Hons) in Economics and Finance.
            Back then, my dream was to dive headfirst into the finance industry and put all that knowledge to good use. 
            However, reality hit hard as I realised I had limited experience in the field, making it quite challenging to land a job.
            Nonetheless, along the way, I created some fantastic memories and learned valuable lessons that shaped me into who I am today.

          <em>Feb 2014</em>
          <p>	
            I joined Vodafone Group as a Project MI Analyst on a short-term contract. 
            It was my first dive into the world of programming, where I got hands-on 
            experience with HTML and CSS. I was amazed by how 
            I could create cool things just by writing code. I was also exposed to 
             "Big Data" during my time there. I discovered how telecoms use it 
             to gain valuable insights and stay competitive in this fast-paced industry. 
             It hit me that this applied to so many other fields too. üíª üìä üåê

          <p>	
            Hellbent on working in finance at the time, I landed a role in the restructuring divison of RBS.
            I primarily engaged in the meticulous capture and, to some extent, cleansing of data. 
            Our team then entrusted the data to the skilled hands of data modelers, 
            who conjured valuable insights with their sorcery-like expertise.
            It was in this role that I truly appreciated the impact of "big data" on business decisions. 
            This was an area that fascinated me and so I read more and more eventually coming across 
            machine learning. It was early days but there was much promise on the impact of ML on this world.
            To get involved in and to make an impact I needed to upskill and develop a core understanding of ML.

          <h3>MSc Data Science @ City, University of London üéì</h3>
          <em>Sep 2016</em>
          <p>	
            This was a course with a steep learning curve provided you chose challenging modules [Distinction obtained]. 
            I was determined to build a strong foundation in AI/ML, so I chose modules that aligned 
            with my interests, like computer vision and reinforcement learning. 
            I got really serious about coding and ended up burning the midnight oil to 
            catch up with my engineering-savvy peers. My poor laptop, 
            it endured countless hours of coding sessions. 
            This course also provided an excellent opportunity to network and forge friendships 
            with fellow aspiring data scientists who are still actively making waves in the field today.

          <h3>NLP internship ü§ñ @ Research Centre for Machine Learning, City, University of London</h3>
          <em>Jul 2017</em>
          <p>	
            In my first venture into NLP, I augmented Neural Language Models by 
            integrating Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tags into LSTM and GRU recurrent neural 
            network architectures, leveraging valuable structural information. 
            It was quite a challenging learning experience both on the theoretical front and in terms of programming challenges, 
            but it allowed me to apply the concepts I had learned during my degree to a long-term project. 
            This experience served as a solid foundation, preparing me for my next ambitious pursuit: a PhD.

          <h3>PhD program @ CVSSP, University of Surrey üéì</h3>
          <em>Feb 2018</em>
          <p>	Undoubtedly the most significant and challenging phase of my career, 
            I received a fully funded studentship from Zoetis and NPL, leading me to 
            embark on a PhD journey at CVSSP. Under the guidance of 
            Dr. Kevin Wells, Prof. Miroslaw Bober, Dr. Spencer Angus Thomas, 
            and Prof. Roberto La Ragione, I delved into multiple projects centered around AI/ML, 
            computer vision, and diagnostic analysis of biopsy images. 
            Over the course of nearly five years, I acquired invaluable scientific and 
            technical knowledge, presenting and published extensively at renowned medical imaging conferences worldwide as well as journals. 
            My works can be found on Google Scholar and ResearchGate. Personally and professionally, this period was an absolute rollercoaster. 
            There were definitely some chaotic moments that pushed me to develop my technical skills like never before. ü§ñ üî¨ üß† üíª
